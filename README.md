### Learnings

*   Pre-Planning. It's a structural difference if you _wait_ for an terminal input or begin a process by clicking a field. Think about this before, get frustrated less.
*   More elagant to return to outcome of an comprehension then simply “true” or “false”. Working with “truthy” & “falsy” seems to be okay.
